"Expand the World," you'll enhance the in-memory representation of your game world in C#. This involves adding more diverse room types, possibly items, and other features that make the world more interesting and interactive. Here's how you can approach this expansion:

### Mini-Adventure 2: Expand the World

**Objective**: Enrich the game world with various room types, items, and features.

**Tasks**:
1. Introduce different types of rooms (e.g., treasure rooms, trap rooms).
2. Add items that can be found or interacted with in rooms.
3. Implement basic descriptions and interactions for these new elements.

**Concepts Introduced**: Advanced data structures, object-oriented programming, basic interaction mechanics.

### Implementing the Expansion

#### 1. Enhancing the Room Class

First, you'll want to add more characteristics to your `Room` class to support different types of rooms and items.

**Room.cs**

```csharp
using System.Collections.Generic;

namespace DragonsQuest
{
    public class Room
    {
        public string Description { get; private set; }
        public bool IsPassable { get; private set; }
        public List<Item> Items { get; private set; }

        public Room(string description, bool isPassable)
        {
            Description = description;
            IsPassable = isPassable;
            Items = new List<Item>();
        }

        public void AddItem(Item item)
        {
            Items.Add(item);
        }
    }
}
```

#### 2. Creating an Item Class

Create a new class to represent items that can be found in the game.

**Item.cs**

```csharp
namespace DragonsQuest
{
    public class Item
    {
        public string Name { get; private set; }
        public string Description { get; private set; }

        public Item(string name, string description)
        {
            Name = name;
            Description = description;
        }
    }
}
```

#### 3. Expanding the World Initialization

Modify the `Initialize` method in the `World` class to create a more diverse set of rooms with items.

**World.cs**

```csharp
// ... existing code ...

public void Initialize()
{
    // ... existing initialization code ...

    // Example: Adding a treasure room
    grid[2, 2] = new Room("Treasure Room", true);
    grid[2, 2].AddItem(new Item("Golden Crown", "A shiny golden crown, studded with jewels."));

    // Example: Adding a trap room
    grid[3, 3] = new Room("Trap Room", true);

    // Continue adding more rooms and features as needed
}

// ... existing code ...
```

#### 4. Updating the Display

You might want to update the `DisplayWorld` method to show different symbols for different room types or items.

**World.cs**

```csharp
public void DisplayWorld()
{
    for (int y = 0; y < Height; y++)
    {
        for (int x = 0; x < Width; x++)
        {
            Room room = grid[x, y];
            if (!room.IsPassable)
                Console.Write("#");
            else if (room.Items.Count > 0)
                Console.Write("T"); // T for Treasure
            else
                Console.Write(" ");
        }
        Console.WriteLine();
    }
}
```

### Conclusion

With these enhancements, your game world now contains various types of rooms and items, making it more engaging and interactive. Players can start to explore different rooms, each with its unique characteristics and contents. This sets the stage for further development, such as adding player interactions with these items, more complex room types, and perhaps even NPCs or enemies.
