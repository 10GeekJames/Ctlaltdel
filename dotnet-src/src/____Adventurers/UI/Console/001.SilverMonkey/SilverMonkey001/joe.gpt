I am writing a C# code to roll a die and output the result. It needs to be capable of doing the following while running in the console:
-Collect a username
-Validate the username with the user and welcome them
-Can change the username when desired
-Accept the whole words like "yes" and "no" as well as letters such as "y" or "n". Allow for upper or lower case
-Ask how many sides the die has making sure it is either 4,6,8,10,12,20, or 100
-If the die roll is 20 and the rolled number is also 20 then display "***** Congrats on the Nat20! *****"
-Roll the die
-Display the result and which die was used
-Ask if they want to roll again. 
   If they say "yes", roll the same die again
   If they say "no", Input for die number as above
   If they say "change" allow them to changetheir username
-Also, if in any input they put "exit" or "x" then exit the program
    Ask if they are sure that they want to exit before closing the program


- start by asking for a username and greet them
- display a menu with the options the roll a die, change user, or exit
-
