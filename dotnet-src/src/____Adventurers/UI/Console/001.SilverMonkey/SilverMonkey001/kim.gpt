I am writing a C# code to roll a die and output the result. It needs to be capable of doing the following while running in the console
Collect a username, 
validate the username, 
can change username as desired
Ask how many sides the die has making sure it is either 4,6,8,10,12,20, or 100
Roll the die
Display the result and which die was used
Ask if they want to roll again. accept the whole words like "yes" and "no" as well as letters such as "y" or "n". Allow for upper or lower case
If input is "yes" or "y", roll the same die again 
If input is "no" or "n", have the user input the die number making sure it is either 4,6,8,10,12,20, or 100
At the start, tell the user for them to exit the application, they can input "exit" or "x" then the application will exit 
The application will exit by the input of "exit" or "x"
